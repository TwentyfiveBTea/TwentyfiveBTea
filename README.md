## Hi there 👋  
Welcome to my space 🌿  

✨ A little about me  
I’m a developer who loves crafting clean code & beautiful things.  
Currently exploring **Java + Spring Boot**, diving deep into **backend architecture** and a bit of **frontend aesthetics**.  

☕ Mostly found  
writing code at midnight, tweaking UI palettes, or chasing the perfect font pairing.  

💡 Interests  
- Backend Development  
- System Design & Optimization  
- Minimalist UI  
- Indie aesthetics  

🪶 Words I live by  
> “Make it simple, but significant.”  

📸 IG vibes: code • coffee • calm  
🎧 Music & mood fuel my flow
